# SomeoneElse-vector-web-display

This is Intended to become a set files needed for a Tilemaker-generated .mbtiles file created via https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-extract can be displayed.  Tilemaker's example files for OMT can be found at https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker/tree/master/server/static (but note that the .mbtiles processed here contains different data to an OMT one).

Files are served using Apache, together with https://github.com/systemed/mod_mbtiles .

Not yet functional - still very much a work in progress.
