# Style for use with OSMF shortbread tiles

This map style looks at the data in OSMF's [demo vector tiles](https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/vector-tiles-on-osmf-hardware/121501).  For details of the schema see the [schema documentation](https://shortbread-tiles.org/schema/1.0/).  The icons used here were created for the [svwd01](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-web-display/blob/main/resources/README_svwd01.md) style.  

Most data in the tiles is shown in some form with only minor low-use exceptions.  In addition, some data that is in the tiles but not in the schema (like busways) is also shown.

Cartography is based on [this style](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-extract/blob/main/resources/README_sve01.md), in turn based on [this](https://map.atownsend.org.uk/maps/map/map.html) which in turn was developed from that found in [OSM Carto](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_Carto#Forks_and_independent_deployments) circa 2014, based in turn on the "[Mapnik style](https://github.com/openstreetmap/mapnik-stylesheets)" from considerably earlier.

The fonts used are from [Klokantech](https://github.com/klokantech/klokantech-gl-fonts), in turn based on Google's [noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto).
