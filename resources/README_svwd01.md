# Display style for use with schema [sve01]https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-extract/blob/main/resources/README_sve01.md)

The cartography here is basically a reimplementation of the raster maps at [map.atownsend.org.uk](https://map.atownsend.org.uk/).  The schema described [here](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-extract/blob/main/resources/README_sve01.md) broadly matches that from [here](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-style), and the display code essentially reimplements [this](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/openstreetmap-carto-AJT).

There has been some consolidation of layers, and any "new" vector lua code is designed to be compatible with raster input data too.

For the processing code shared between display styles and the other map styles here, see [this](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-web-display/blob/main/README.md).
