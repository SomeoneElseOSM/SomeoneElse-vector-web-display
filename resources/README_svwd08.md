# A experimental display style showing "roads you can safely walk on".

Motorways are omitted (although motorway bridges that other things go under are shown as bridges).

Trunk, primary and secondary roads are shown if there is there is a sidewalk or verge (or ford).

Tertiary roads and below are shown (it's not universal, but you can safely walk on many of those even without a verge).

The vector tile schema is identical to [svwd01](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-extract/blob/main/resources/README_sve01.md).

The cartography is also the same as [svwd01](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-extract/blob/main/resources/README_sve01.md), which in turn is based on [this](https://map.atownsend.org.uk/maps/map/map.html) which in turn was developed from that found in [OSM Carto](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_Carto#Forks_and_independent_deployments) circa 2014, based in turn on the "[Mapnik style](https://github.com/openstreetmap/mapnik-stylesheets)" from considerably earlier.

The fonts used are from [Klokantech](https://github.com/klokantech/klokantech-gl-fonts), in turn based on Google's [noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto).
