# Display style for use with shortbread schema

See the schema [documentation](https://shortbread-tiles.org/schema/1.0/).

This is a globe variant of the [svwd03](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-web-display/blob/main/resources/README_svwd03.md) map style.  See that readme for technical detail.  See also [this](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/examples/display-a-globe-with-a-vector-map/) MapLibre example.

The [Shortbread](https://shortbread-tiles.org/) vector tile schema.

The [OSMF minutely updated vector tiles demo](https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/minutely-updated-vector-tiles-demo/110121), which the "spec" file here uses as a source.

Cartography is based on [svwd01](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-extract/blob/main/resources/README_sve01.md), in turn based on [this](https://map.atownsend.org.uk/maps/map/map.html) which in turn was developed from that found in [OSM Carto](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_Carto#Forks_and_independent_deployments) circa 2014, based in turn on the "[Mapnik style](https://github.com/openstreetmap/mapnik-stylesheets)" from considerably earlier.

The fonts used are from [Klokantech](https://github.com/klokantech/klokantech-gl-fonts), in turn based on Google's [noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto).
