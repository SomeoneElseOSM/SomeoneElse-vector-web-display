# Changes made to the [SVWD08 web display style](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-web-display/blob/main/resources/README_svwd08.md).  

## As yet unreleased
Show `wheelchair` flash on `amenity=restaurant` with no `cuisine`, `cuisine=indian`, `cuisine=chinese`, `cuisine=italian`, `cuisine=fish_and_chips`, `cuisine=burger` and `cuisine=coffee_shop` and synonyms.

## 19/06/2025
Apply a number of style changes from svwd01 to svwd08, correcting some draw order issues and adding some new icon combinations.

## 17/04/2025
Fixed a bug where trunk "bridge sides" weren't being shown if unwalkable - they should appear as it is still a bridge.

## 10/04/2025
First release of this style that "doesn't show roads you can't walk on".
