## 06/07/2025
Replace `cafe` icon with a line-drawn one that looks much nicer.

Show noncommercial art galleries with a unique museum-like icon.

## 19/06/2025
Apply a number of style changes from svwd01 to svwd08, correcting some draw order issues and adding some new icon combinations.

## 17/04/2025
Fixed a bug where trunk "bridge sides" weren't being shown if unwalkable - they should appear as it is still a bridge.

## 10/04/2025
First release of this style that "doesn't show roads you can't walk on".
