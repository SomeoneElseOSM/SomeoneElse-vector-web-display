# Changes made to the [SVWD08 web display style](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-vector-web-display/blob/main/resources/README_svwd08.md).  

## As yet unreleased
Fixed a bug where trunk "bridge sides" weren't being shown if unwalkable - they should appear as it is still a bridge.

## 10/04/2025
First release of this style that "doesn't show roads you can't walk on".
