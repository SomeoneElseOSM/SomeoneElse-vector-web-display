# This script calls svwd_convert_icon_from_raster.sh multiple times to create
# a directory of icons.
#
# It takes no parameters; details are hardcoded below.
# Icons are being created to support the "sve01" schema (with conversions 
# based on SomeoneElse-style).  
#
# In many cases, the icons created are basically placeholders of the right 
# size - they're scaled up from 16x16 or smaller so so will benefit from 
# subsequent editing.
#
# Then, "svwd_create_sprite.sh" can be called to process with "montage" to 
# create an "@2x" ".png" file containing them and an accompanying .json file 
# listing the file names and sizes.  A very wide sprite 1 icon deep is created.
#
# Montage's maximum width is defined in /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml - to
# create wider montages (at the files sizes used, > 256 icons) this value 
# must be increased.

# This icon was derived from one originally designed for use in a raster style.
